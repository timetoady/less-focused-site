Project: Preprocessed CSS

Preprocessing allows for faster and more organized development.  Being able to take a design and convert it into HTML and CSS is a common skill required for full stack developers in any industry. 

Often you get to decide how to build a website but not the content.  This will be a great exercise for you to be creative in a given theme.  All content should be fake, don't waste time with copy writing.

Project Requirements:

1. Fork and clone this Github repository (Links to an external site.)

2. Pick a website of your choosing to mimic the layout with your own code

3. Pick a theme of your choosing to build:

Bike Shop
Bookstore
Spa
4. Website requirements

Create a home page laid out and themed based on your choices from the above steps
Create a secondary page of your choice 
Create a navigation that links between the home and secondary pages.
Create buttons on each page with a call to action for the user.  For example: Sign Up, Buy Now, etc.
5. Preprocessing Requirements

Utilize imports so that only one file is compiled from at least 4 imported files
Utilize variables for a font stack and colors
Nest your selectors so that they match the HTML structure
Create and use 2 unique mixins of your choice
Create a mixin that creates a custom button using parameters.  Apply these styles on the buttons you created in HTML for the home and services page
Create a mobile version of the home and secondary pages using escaped variables.  You can simply stack your content on top of itself, nothing complex is expected
